# Neural-Morphological-Disambiguation-for-Turkish

This is a dynet implementation of the method proposed in following paper:
Shen,et. al. 2017. The Role of Context in Neural Morphological Disambiguation COLING 2016

A surface context model is one of the methods proposed in the study and perform best for Turkish morphological disambiguation among 4 proposed methods.
All the methods are based on character level bidirectional LSTM networks and surface context model represent the context applying LSTMs onsurface word forms.
Here, we provide an implementation of this method written in dynet. We also provide train and test sets for Turkish morphological disambiguation.

This repository is under construction. Athough everything is working now, we will provide a better organized tool with a well written documentaion soon.

For the details about the method, please see the Shen's study.

By the way, we just started to work on a projext about joint dependecy parsing and morphological disambiguation and this tool is developed for this project.

Do not hesitate to contact if you have any questions.
